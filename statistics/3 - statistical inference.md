# Statistical Inference
- Population: Entire group of subjects about which we want information
- Parameter: The quantity we are interested in
- Sample: A portion of population
- Statistic (Estimate): Measurement of `parameter` in our `sample`

## Bias
Systematic errors in sampling.

- Selection bias
- Non-response bias
- Voluntary response bias

# Sampling Design
- Simple random sample: Select subjects at random without replacement
- Stratified random sample: Divide the population into classes of similar subjects (strata) and choose a simple random sample in each stratum.

## Chance Error
Since the sample is drawn at random, the estimate might be different from the parameter. Different samples result in different chance errors.
$$estimate = parameter + bias + chance error$$

- Gets smaller as the sample size grows.

# Randomized Controlled Experiments
- Divide people into two groups: **treatment group** and **control group**.

- Compare the outcomes in the two groups.
- Groups should be similar except for the treatment:
  - Assign groups to subjects at random.
  - Give **placebo**s to the control group.
  - Experiment should be **double blind**.
